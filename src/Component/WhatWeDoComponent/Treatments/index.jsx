                                If a stone is less than 4mm (or 0.2ins),
                                it is considered to be small enough to be passed
                                out of the body via urine without any intervention.
                                You may be given medication to help with
                                the pain and possibly anti-emetics,
                                if you have strong feelings of nausea.
                                Although many people manage well with this approach,
                                others need more urgent, hospital treatment for stones.

                                    Unlike other organs in the body, the prostate
                                    gland continues to grow during every man’s lifespan.
                                    The prostate grows gradually after the age of about
                                    50 and by the age of 70, approximately 8 out of 10
                                    men have an enlarged prostate.

                                <li>Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer. For many,
